Corporate O
America B-LOC
is O
planning O
major O
changes O
in O
employee O
compensation O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years O
, O
according O
to O
a O
recent O
study O
. O

The O
survey O
, O
conducted O
in O
late O
1995 O
and O
the O
early O
part O
of O
this O
year O
by O
management O
consulting O
firm O
Towers B-ORG
Perrin I-ORG
, O
showed O
that O
the O
focus O
will O
be O
on O
an O
employee O
's O
overall O
value O
to O
the O
company O
's O
bottom O
line O
-- O
rather O
than O
how O
well O
an O
employee O
performs O
a O
specific O
task O
. O

Presently O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
an O
accountant O
's O
job O
involves O
doing O
five O
specific O
tasks O
, O
he O
or O
she O
can O
expect O
a O
certain O
salary O
, O
said O
Sandra B-PER
O'Neal I-PER
, O
a O
Towers B-ORG
Perrin I-ORG
principal O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
, O
if O
you O
're O
highly O
skilled O
and O
have O
many O
abilities O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
paid O
more O
, O
said O
O'Neal B-PER
. O

This O
coming O
shift O
, O
O'Neal B-PER
said O
, O
is O
not O
just O
isolated O
or O
a O
fad O
. O

Multi-layers O
kept O
management O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
its O
customers O
, O
O'Neal B-PER
said O
. O

O'Neal B-PER
says O
firms O
will O
place O
a O
greater O
emphasis O
on O
teams O
and O
team O
performance O
in O
giving O
raises O
. O

That O
's O
an O
important O
question O
we O
used O
to O
ask O
a O
lot O
, O
said O
O'Neal B-PER
. O

Companies O
that O
can O
change O
their O
culture O
and O
view O
employees O
as O
business O
partners O
will O
do O
well O
, O
O'Neal B-PER
said O
. O

They O
respect O
employees O
more O
, O
they O
trust O
employees O
more O
and O
they O
value O
their O

until O

further O

that O

needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU B-ORG
Farm O

Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

from O
the O

food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide B-MISC
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC

France B-LOC
that O
under O

Fischler B-PER

standing O

committee O

mational O

questioned O
if O

The O

Foreign O
Minister O
I.K. B-PER
Gujral I-PER
was O
asked O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
if O
India B-LOC
's O
decision O
to O
block O
adoption O
of O
the O
accord O
in O
Geneva B-LOC
would O
lead O
to O
an O
arms O
race O
with O
Pakistan B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
possibility O
because O
India B-LOC
is O
not O
entering O
into O
any O
arms O
race O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Our O
not O
signing O
a O
new O

does O
not O
mean O
we O
are O
going O
in O
for O
any O
new O
kind O

. O

China B-LOC

France B-LOC

Russia B-LOC

the O
United B-LOC

, O
is O
a O

. O

India B-LOC
carried O
out O
a O
nuclear O
test O
in O
1974 O
but O
says O
it O
has O
not O
built O
the O

. O

Experts O
believe O
both O
India B-LOC
and O
Pakistan B-LOC
could O
quickly O
assemble O

. O

Gujral B-PER
said O
he O
did O
not O
expect O
India B-LOC

of O
the O
Comprehensive B-MISC
Test I-MISC
Ban I-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
( O

Gujral B-PER
said O
India B-LOC
would O
re-examine O
its O
position O
if O
the O
treaty O
, O
particularly O
a O
clause O

its O

Gujral B-PER

In O
a O

to O
the O
treaty O
, O
under O
negotiation O
at O
the O
Conference B-MISC
on I-MISC
Disarmament I-MISC
in O
Geneva B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
a O
sad O
fact O
that O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
states O
show O
no O
interest O
in O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear O
hegemony O
, O
the O
statement O
said O
. O

Gujral B-PER
said O
India B-LOC
had O
national O
security O
concerns O
that O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
New B-LOC
Delhi I-LOC
to O
sign O
the O
CTBT B-MISC
. O

Our O
security O
concerns O
oblige O
us O
to O
maintain O
our O

option O
, O
he O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
India B-LOC

exercised O

any O

since O

Up O

100,000 O

held O
in O

confounding O
the O

fate O
, O
probably O
belongs O

said O
on O
Friday O

Around O
40,000 O

of O
the O
copper O
have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O
warehouses O
near O
the O
northern O

where O
some O
of O
the O

, O
they O
said O

Just O
who O
owns O
the O
copper O
is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O
traders O

guessing O
since O
the O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
40,000 O

had O
cleared O
customs O
-- O
which O
would O
provide O
some O

But O
one O

the O
head O
of O
a O
Hong B-LOC

trading O
house O
, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O
copper O
was O
customs O
cleared O
or O
not O
. O

If O
they O
spend O
all O
this O
money O
moving O
the O

to O
Yingkou B-LOC

it O

be O
sitting O
there O

out O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai B-LOC
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O

unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O

it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O

backwardation O
on O
the O
London B-ORG

CNIEC B-ORG
lent O
around O
85,000 O

onto O
the O

between O
April O

June O
1995 O
on O

running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia B-LOC
said O
CNIEC B-ORG
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ B-MISC
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O
and O
$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC B-ORG
a O
healthy O
profit O
, O
which O
could O
then O
have O
been O
used O
to O
finance O

they O
were O
unaware O
of O

out O

They O
also O
expressed O
concern O
that O
the O

move O

the O

But O
these O
concerns O

that O

hit O

They O
show O
that O

aware O
that O
Dutroux B-PER

building O
cells O

some O
of O

that O

the O
house O
where O
Julie B-PER

Melissa B-PER

his O
word O
that O
the O

last O

But O
none O

carrying O

any O
of O

violations O
of O
human O
rights O
which O
Tutu B-PER

investigating O
. O

Human O
rights O
lawyer O
Brian B-PER
Currin I-PER
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O
hit-squad O

Dirk B-PER
Coetzee I-PER
, O
have O
yet O
to O

. O

Tutu B-PER

, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine I-PER
, O
told O
reporters O
the O

would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B-PER
Botha I-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O

aims O
. O

He O
cited O
Coetzee B-PER
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O

dirty O

. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O

start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin B-PER
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O

But O
Enderle B-PER

the O

Microsoft B-ORG

was O
going O

the O
answer O

Winkler B-PER

Many O

But O
now O
that O

Winkler B-PER

The O

agreed O
this O

to O
rethink O
a O

the O

after O
some O

EU B-ORG
Farm O

banning O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O
cords O
from O

contract O
Bovine B-MISC

-- O
mad O
cow O

. O

But O
some O
members O
of O
the O
EU B-ORG

standing O

committee O
questioned O
whether O
the O
action O
was O
necessary O
given O
the O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

The O
question O
is O
being O
studied O
separately O
by O
two O
EU B-ORG

committees O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O

to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O

. O

British B-MISC
officials O
say O
sheep O
meat O
is O
perfectly O
safe O

After O
the O
British B-MISC

admitted O
a O

between O
mad O

fatal O
human O

the O
EU B-ORG
